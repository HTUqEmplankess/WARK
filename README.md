## Project Objective

This project aims to create a contactless sleep monitoring device that tracks sleep quality indicators such as snoring, movement, and environmental conditions. Data is logged to Google Sheets for long-term analysis and Blynk for web dashboard provides real-time updates and control of a bedside light. Excessive snoring triggers an Line notification to alert the user.
